## Purpose of the Website
This site is for learning HTML/CSS and to build a place to put other projects to practice writing. Hopefully one day it will be a place to point people to get some idea of what I can do, whether that will be the coding or Mechanical Engineering projects. It may even be a place to write about motorsports that I follow with a technical twist.
### Why GitHub?
This site is hosted on GitHub because it gives me a constraint of not have the abilities to do anything other then serve static sites and not get to stuck into the details of frontends/backends of making a website as Iâ€™m a mechanical engineering major.
### Why not something simpler like use Wordpress or squarespace?
This was to gives me a opportunity to learn some code and reach outside my comfort zone on the technical side as well. Like learning to write HTML code thats friendly for all devices or how to make a webste friendly for posting content.
