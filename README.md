## Purpose of the Website
This site is for learning HTML/CSS and to build a place to put other project to practice writing. Hopefully one day it will be a place to point people to get some idea of what I can do, whether that will be the coding or Mechanical Engineering projects. It may even be a place to write about motorsports that I follow with a technical twist.
### Why GitHub?
This site is hosted on GitHub because it gives me a constraint of not have the abilities to do anything other then serve static sites and not get to stuck into the details of frontends/backends of making a website as Iâ€™m a mechanical engineering major.
### Why not something simpler?
This was to gives me a opportunity to learn some code and reach outside my comfort zone on the technical side as well. Like learn to write HTML code thats friendly for all devices.
