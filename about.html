        <h2>Welcome to the site!</h2>
        <p>
          
        This site is going to a personal spot for all my project that go on in my free time. While this may 
        not be update dated as much as I would like I will still try to do it much as possible. I spend a lot of my
        time at work but during my days off i uselly spend it with my girlfriend and riding motorcycle. 
        hopefully this site will not only be a place for technical articales but also some hobby prodject having to 
        do with motocross and motorcycles in general.<br><br><br>
        
        P.S.  I still  think Adrianna is a cutie. :^)
