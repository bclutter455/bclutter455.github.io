    New Bike Day</h2>
    <h3>9-24-2022</h3>
    <p class="mainpar">
      &emsp;&emsp;I think motorcycles are cool, so I bought a another one. The only issue is I can only
      guarantee at least one bike for this period in my life right now and may lose access to my other bikes.
      Fast forward me browsing craigslist every day for a couple months
      straight and I was able to get what I wanted. Not just any bike though, but one of the most
      versatile bikes available. So, are we talking about a big giant Adventure bike, right? Not
      exactly. How about an old DRZ? Closer but missing one key aspect. I wanted this bike to not only
      be able to do anything but to be able to be competitive in a most races, which is very
      different when people think of a do it all bike because you end up with bike that’s
       not great on the road. I think this bike can ready do it all though.
    </p>
    <p>    
      &emsp;&emsp;So, I grabbed myself a hardly ridden 2019 CRF450l for 8gs with only 284 miles on the odometer and that
      was the start of it all. Now this isn’t a bike I’m going to have and turn around and sell in 
      couple years, I’m riding this thing into the ground dragging it from state to state with me as I 
      start my career in engineering and its going to switch jobs as much as indecisive freshman in 
      collage. One of the first things you expect me to do is get a pipe and ECU, but not I’m leaving stock 
      as I love a quite bike and the mellow smooth power delivery this thing has (that is after you 
      remove the backfire screen from the air filter).
    </p> 
    <p>
      &emsp;&emsp;So here is a little background to help you understand why I picked this bike. I grew 
      up riding dirt bikes and racing throughout my teenage years, even entered a couple WORCS races. 
      Now I’m in my late twenties and always up for going out into the wild completely unprepared 
      whether that be the open water or deserts of Arizona. So why did I get this bike over a KTM EXC? 
      Well for one thing its quieter and vibrates a lot less, second, it’s a Honda so I can get parts for 
      it anywhere, and last this shares it’s motor(mostly) and suspension with all the modern Honda 450’s of 
      which I happen to own a 2020 CRF450r at the moment.This means I can directly take that’s bikes 
      wheels and suspension and throw them on big L and go to town at the mx track abiet with 60 
      extra pounds wet. I think it's 90 as competitive as the EXC and twice a good to own and live with on the daily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &emsp;&emsp;When got the bike it had a sad set of saggy foot pegs that weren’t made for the bike and
      leopard print seat cover. The good thing was even though they didn’t mention the scrapes from dropping it on the road
      I could tell this bike had never been offroad and still had original seat cover(100+ dollars saved).
