    <h2> <br><br><br><br>
      New Bike Day</h2>
    <h3>24-Sep-2022</h3>
    <p class="mainpar">
      &emsp;&emsp;I think motorcycles are cool, so I bought a another one. The only issue is I can only
      guarantee at least one bike for this period in my life right now and may lose access to my other bikes.
      Fast forward me browsing craigslist every day for a couple months
      straight and I was able to get what I wanted. Not just any bike though, but one of the most
      versatile bikes available. So, are we talking about a big giant Adventure bike, right? Not
      exactly. How about an old DRZ? Closer but missing one key aspect. I wanted this bike to not only
      be able to do anything but to be able to be competitive in a most races, which is very
      different when people think of a do it all bike because you end up with bike that’s
      not great on the road. I think this bike can ready do it all though.
    </p>
    <p>
      &emsp;&emsp;So, I grabbed myself a hardly ridden 2019 CRF450l for 8gs with only 284 miles on the odometer and that
      was the start of it all. Now this isn’t a bike I’m going to have and turn around and sell in
      couple years, I’m riding this thing into the ground dragging it from state to state with me as I
      start my career in engineering and its going to switch jobs as much as indecisive freshman in
      collage. One of the first things you expect me to do is get a pipe and ECU, but not I’m leaving stock
      as I love a quite bike and the mellow smooth power delivery this thing has (that is after you
      remove the backfire screen from the air filter).
    </p>
    <p>
      &emsp;&emsp;So here is a little background to help you understand why I picked this bike. I grew
      up riding dirt bikes and racing throughout my teenage years, even entered a couple WORCS races.
      Now I’m in my late twenties and always up for going out into the wild completely unprepared
      whether that be the open water or deserts of Arizona. So why did I get this bike over a KTM EXC?
      Well for one thing its quieter and vibrates a lot less, second, it’s a Honda so I can get parts for
      it anywhere, and last this shares it’s motor(mostly) and suspension with all the modern Honda 450’s of
      which I happen to own a 2020 CRF450r at the moment.This means I can directly take that’s bikes
      wheels and suspension and throw them on big L and go to town at the mx track abiet with 60
      extra pounds wet. I think it's 90 as competitive as the EXC and twice a good to own and live with on the daily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &emsp;&emsp;When got the bike it had a sad set of saggy foot pegs that weren’t made for the bike and
      a leopard print seat cover. The good thing was I could tell this bike had never been offroad,
      even thoughthey didn’t mention the scraps from dropping it on the road. 
      A new air filter to replace the original that was falling apart, a bit of grease, and the bike was ready to go.
    </p>
    <p>
      &emsp;&emsp;The next thing that had to be put into order was the rider to be able to ride anywhere
      and anything. So, the motos and diet had to start. Needed to drop about 30 pounds and get pass
      5 Laps of pushing on the moto Track. I started riding twice a week, running twice a week, and
      cut a meal out every day starting in October of 2022. Any type of riding helped at this point
      I was so out of it. Next thing I did was sign myself up for a race, I picked a December GP at
      canyon raceway to work toward. This would be a 50 min race on a 7 to 10 mile loop.
    </p>
    <h3>Race 1 Report:</h3>
    <p>
      &emsp;&emsp;The middle of Dec rolls around much quicker than I expected, I had only got about dozens
      rides in but ready as ever. Dec 17th and have to get up at 4am to get to race on time for practice
      at 7:30 and ride my first time on a motocross track in about 2 years. Lucky for its canyon raceway
      so it hardly changed in about decade to tackling it with 285lb bike shouldn’t be so bad. The only 
      things done to the bike was putting on a set of Dunlop en91 tire (great tire but only for about 6 
      hours), rim locks, kickstand bypass, new grips, removed mirrors, remove backfire screen, removed 
      license plate holder, and some duct tape numbers. 
    </p>
    <p>
      &emsp;&emsp;First practice and the nerves have ready set in and ride fast like that but also don’t 
      breathe the entire time. It’s a mass start and I’m blowing pass people as the off-road sections are
      still smooth but sun it still in my eyes to blow off back a berm at 40 mph and run into two big
      green jumping Cholla’s. Green cactus pulp is everywhere but at least I didn’t go down and the
      front wheel handled most of the needles, just bit in my right hand I had take out with tweezers.
      I call that a big success as I got most of the jumps in 2 laps even though I did get major arm
      pump in about 6 mins. 
    </p>
   
    <p>
      &emsp;&emsp;Unfortunately, my B class race was at 2pm after the Team Race (main event), ATVs, and UTV.
      I was in for a long day and rough courses.  At least I had time for my arm pump to calm down, 
      but it was warm, dusty, and rough by the time my race came around. For the start I was able to
      snag a top ten start of about 30 people on the gate only to realize my stock suspension was not
      even close to being stiff enough to handle the course. While training the suspension was fine as
      I only did off road trails, but as soon as I hit tight 2+ foot plus bump and whoops I quickly
      bottomed out even going slow. I quickly got a major arm pump but was able to ride through it as
      the motocross track was smooth and easy to ride plus, I jumped things other didn’t in my class.
      In the end I got 5th in my class out of 7 and 14/30 in the entire race, which I call a huge
      success even if I didn’t move forward at all because I didn’t crash and got out healthy.
