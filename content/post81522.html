    <h2> <br><br><br><br>
    Procrastination</h2>
    <h3>8-15/2022</h3>
    <p class="mainpar">
      &emsp;&emsp;Sometimes I just look around and what I’m doing and then I compare myself
      to what other people are doing. And they see them with websites, photos, social media, girlfriends, full-time job, and
      and finishing graduate school. And I think how do they get all these things done and I can’t get anything done it seems.
      And it’s always on one of those weeks we’re all I did was go to work and get my laundry done and give my love the attention she needs. 
      But then I look back I look at my project folder in my computer and I look how many things I started, I’ve done, and all the hobbies I’ve had over the years 
      from running to climbing to dirt biking to all the models I'v made and I realize I’ve been doing stuff the entire time without even knowing it.
      Just cause I was slow this week doesn’t nor was it the week before I just have a short memory of all of the work i get done. The mind
      wants to beat me up not getting all the things I want want to get done. When I look back I also think where I was thinking things like "I should be
      farther along with the website" or "I should’ve done more coding" with a carrer in mind that could have been. <br><br> &emsp;&emsp;I honestly can look at all the years
      I have thought that I was doing nothing and then see that I accomplished and it was all in just five years. I have to be thankful for all the people I’ve met and the 
      opportunities I’ve had. I have progressed with so many projects in just a short time. I think really my mind is just trying to remind me that I could be doing
      so much more because I have done it and I keep doing it year after year. Just like this post it’s going to get me finishing one more project here on this
      website at least for this week.
