      <p>
        &emsp;Sometimes I just look around and see what I have been doing and this lead me to compare myself to what
        other people are doing. I see them with websites, photos, social media, girlfriends, full-time job, and
        finishing graduate school and I can't help but wonder how they are doing it all, while I can’t seem to get
        anything done. And it’s always on one of those weeks we’re all I did was go to work and get my laundry done and
        give my give a little time to my partner. But then I look back over the past few months at my project folder an
        I look how many things I started, I’ve done, and all the hobbies I’ve had over the years from running, climbing,
        dirt biking, and all the models I'v designed then I realize I have been doing stuff the entire time without even
        knowing it. Just cause I was slow this week and I was the week before too doesn't make all of my work I have
        done invalid. It seems my brain always wants to go foward at a never slowing pace. The mind wants to beat me up
        for not getting all the things it wants to get done. When I look back I think of when I was thinking things like
        "I should be farther along with the website" or "I should’ve done more coding" ddreaming of having made those
        items my career path and n ot relizing my path with be what it need to be.
      </p>
      <p>
        I honestly can look at all the years I have thought that I was doing nothing and then see what I accomplished
        and it was so many things in just five years. I have to be thankful for all the people I’ve met and the
        opportunities I’ve had to learn and experience. I have progressed with so many projects in just a short time
        amount of time looking back. I think really my mind is just trying to remind me that I could be doing so much
        more because I have done it so many thing in the past and I keep doing it year after year. Just like this post I
        get to complete one more project this time and one more project here on this website to post about. May you all
        get done what you want to get done to achieve your dreams.
