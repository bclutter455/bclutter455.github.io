      <h2><br />Welcome to the site!</h2>
      <p>
        Thanks for visiting the site. You may have notice that the site is missing some information or contentâ€¦ There is
        a good reason for this as the site was completely built by me. Every piece of code was typed out by hand with
        no prior knowledge of HTML or CSS so that I could/can learn the details of formatting a website without all the
        frame works or generators. This has led to some questionable design choices and a lacking UI so far, but it is
        getting there slowly. Whether or not that was good idea I will find out at the end of the journey, but I will be
        sure to write a post about it when it is all over. In the meantime, you can check back here to see what is
        coming next.
      </p>
      <p>
      This site will be a place for me to post on a varity of topics. This may be engineering topics, motorcycle adventure, how to guides,
       picture I took and their story, or even open souces hardware if I ever get around to it. So take a look in the Blog Posts link if
        you want hear about any of those things.
      </p>
