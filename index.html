    <h2><br><br>Welcome to the site!</h2><br><br>
    <p>Thanks for visiting the site. You may have notice that the site is missing some 
    information or contentâ€¦ There is a good reason for this as this site was completely built by me.
    Every piece of code was typed out by hand with no prior knowledge of HTML or CSS
    so that I could/can learn the details of formatting a website. This has led to some questionable 
    design choices and a lacking UI so far, but it is getting there slowly. Whether or not that was 
    good idea I will find out at the end of the journey, but I will be sure to write a post about it 
    when it is all over. In the meantime, you can check back here to see what is coming next.<br>

    <br>Below is a log of changes that are being made to site. 
    It is ever evolving and hopefully should reflect on GitHub if I keep up with it there.<br>

    <br>1.Style of pages will be finalized and it still needs a footer<br>
    <del>2.color side bar for practice and style</del> I didn't like it and it wasn;t important for the purpose of this site<br>
    <del>3.Top row/header</del> Done!<br>
    4.Intro<br>
    <del>5.A Logo idea,</del> something simple for Top. Still needs to be refined<br>
    6.A post of some type
    <br>
    <br>P.S. Adrianna is cute. :^)
